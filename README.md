# Fun-App

Made this app to learn to change the existing Views. In this when button is clicked ImageView and TextView data gets changed. 

For ImageView use <b> setImageResource() </b> method and for TextView <b> setText() </b>  method.
  
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/Image 1.jpeg" width="400"/></td>
    <td><img src="/Image 2.jpeg" width="400"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
